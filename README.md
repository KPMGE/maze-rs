# maze-rs

This is a simple maze-generator program made in rust

### How do i run it? :running:
In order to run this project, first make sure you have the [rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
properly installed. If so, you can run this project with the following command: 

```bash
cargo run
```

### Buildig :hammer:
If you wanna build this project to production instead of just running it, you
can do so by using cargo again: 

```bash
cargo build --release
```
It will compile the program and generate an optimized executable of it in the
`target/release/maze-rs` location.

Now you can run it directly: 

```bash
./target/release/maze-rs
```

Have fun! :tada:
